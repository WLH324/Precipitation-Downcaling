# Precipitation-Downcaling
All the scripts are post-processing steps following the downscaling operation using MGWR 2.2 software, and should be executed sequentially according to their file names.
The script "1_CSV interpolation" performs interpolation of the coefficients and residuals obtained from the MGWR output to the target resolution, facilitating the generation of high-resolution precipitation results in subsequent steps.
